# **Howdy, I'm Khayla Saunders** 🤠👩🏾‍💻  
## Welcome to my Git Crib!
Feel free to call me Khai! I love having sidebar chit-chats to make connections, laugh, and work hard. Integrity is essential to me. One of my favorite quotes is from the GOAT Lebron "I know we're out [of]  the playoff race, but if I'm on the court, I'm going to play how I play, and I play to win. So, I **never will cheat the game**...".
## A few not so essential, basics
- I use she/her/hers pronouns
- 3x Gen Philadelphian! GO BIRDS! (Still learning football...BUT I frequent West Point games to support my little BIG cousin!)
- I can get a little southern, I went to undergrad at THE BEST HBCU, Tuskegee University
- I earned my Master's in  Historic Preservation from the University of Pennsylvania, where I enjoyed breaking traditional norms to save Black Philly Gems...check out my work with the [Tanner House](https://www.inquirer.com/arts/tanner-house-community-outreach-report-20240910.html)!
- I need my Mushroom Coffee Daily (Everyday Doze) 🍄
  
### Work Routine
I am at my best in the mornings, and Ready to chat about work from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.
### Best Way to communicate 
- **Email**: For non-urgent but more extended questions, it helps me process more efficiently and think through the problem better.
- **Google Chat:** Best for casual or quick questions and/or conversations.
- **In-person**: MY FAVORITE!
>  **ALSO** Feel Free to tap me, even if I have headphones on (I prefer to work with something in the background).
### How do I like to give feedback? 
I want to meet in person, but if it's easier, I can email you. I'm always taking notes that I can share.
### How do I like to receive feedback? 
In-person is best, but if you don't have any time, email/Google chat is best. 
### My Goal for this year 
I want continuous growth in my faith, to become a software engineer, to go on one international trip, and to keep learning to remain a service person.
